# Simple Cardio Progress Tracker

## Description
If you're like me, I like to start my day early in the morning and get a jumpstart by going straight into my cardio workouts. A lot of times I like to go swimming or running outside and makes wearing any extra gadgets an annoyance or sometimes I would just forget.

I wanted a very simple way to track cardio sessions after the fact so I can stay motivated.

The application is meant to be simple with an easy UI that you can hop on any mobile device and simply enter your minutes logged for the day and it provides your progress in relation to the goals you set.

The problem I hope to solve is to continue people to stay motivated to their goals by providing instant gratification for their results; something that is sometimes not so visible.

As a user, I want to set cardio goals and track my calories burned/weight loss so that I can monitor my progress and stay motivated.

By doing this project, I learned the importance of structuring your application, how to make components out of each of the steps you need to take and then breaking those components up into even more components. Prioritization is super important and understanding what's needed to be functional versus what's a cosmetic need. 

For this application, the formulas needed were far more important that the UI. The UI just needed to be simple. Instead, I spent a lot of time ensuring I had the right functions where I could re-use certain ones to cut down on time. 

## Installation

You just need a web browser and go to
